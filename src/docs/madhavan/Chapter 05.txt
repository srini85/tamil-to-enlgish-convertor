On an auspicious day a few days later, the marriage of Madhavan and Vaidehi took place. That night, Madhavan looked at his wife and said, "I have no desire for this marriage. My parents and yours joined together to conduct this wedding. My devotion is solely for Kannan; my heart yearns only for his vision. I have no interest in this illusory worldly life. I will not touch you. You must not reveal this to anyone; if you do, you shall never see me again." Saying this, he went to sleep in the room where Kannan was kept, as usual.

Nearly a year had passed since Madhavan’s wedding, yet he remained in the same state. Vaidehi did not speak to Madhavan. Madhavan’s mother was bewildered. The father lived by the principle of minding his own business. Life in the house went on somehow. Unable to reveal the truth to the outside world, they lived behind a mask. Madhavan thought to himself, "Let them suffer well. Parents who do not understand my state of mind deserve to endure this. I will not give up my resolve. This is the punishment for parents who do not understand their children's hearts. Kannan, I need your vision. I have no concern for them, nor do I feel their interference. From now on, I shall worship you in peace. At least now, come quickly and grant me your vision. It is only for your sake that I behave this way. Forgive me if I am wrong. Somehow, I must attain your vision; please grant it to me."

Madhavan’s mother asked Vaidehi, "Dear, why don't you go and talk to him?"
"Where is the chance to talk, Mother? He falls silent and leaves the moment he sees me," Vaidehi replied.
"If this continues, what will be the end of it?" the mother asked.
"I don't understand anything either," said Vaidehi.
"I keep making up excuses to those who ask. How much longer can I keep saying such things?" the mother lamented.
"Mother, did he marry me without any liking for me?" Vaidehi asked.
"It wasn't just you; he didn't want marriage at all. I was the one who stubbornly forced it upon him. I never thought he would take revenge on me like this," the mother said, her eyes welling with tears.
"Should I go to my mother's house for a while? Until his mind changes?" Vaidehi suggested.
"Wait, we will find a way. If you leave, this situation will only persist. Your father-in-law says he will retire from work soon. If he stays home after retirement, the pain will only increase. Even now, he goes about his work with a heavy heart. I don't understand why he is like this despite having everything," she grumbled.

Vaidehi looked at her mother-in-law in silence.
"Yes, your wedding anniversary is next week, isn't it? Try talking to him yourself. I will also ask him to take you to the temple. Let's see if a way opens up that day," said Madhavan’s mother.
Both returned to their chores.

That dawn, Madhavan woke up as usual, finished his services to Kannan, and came out. Vaidehi came and fell at Madhavan’s feet.
"Why are you falling at my feet? Fall at Kannan’s feet," Madhavan said.
"No, it's our wedding anniversary," Vaidehi said fearfully.
"Whose wedding?" Madhavan asked. He had even forgotten that he was married.
Madhavan’s mother called out from inside, "What is this, Madhava? Are you joking? It has been a year since you and Vaidehi got married."
"Fine, what of it now?" he asked in a loud voice.
"Take her to a temple somewhere," the mother said.
"My Kannan is everything. Tell her to go and worship my Kannan," Madhavan said irritably.
"It would be nice if you both worshipped together," the mother said.
"Mother, are you going to stay quiet or not? Why are you pestering me? If she wants, tell her to worship and leave," Madhavan said.
He walked away, cursing his mother in his mind: "She did what I didn't want, and now she laments in vain."

Vaidehi sat before Kannan and cried, "Is he even human to behave like this? Does he truly have devotion? I cannot understand him at all! What sin did I commit to get trapped with him? Kannan, don't you have consorts too? Don't you understand my suffering? When will a path open for me? Will there be no dawn for me?"
Madhavan ignored everything and disappeared. Many days passed like this.

One day, news came that Vaidehi’s father had passed away. Madhavan’s father called him and said, "You must take your wife there properly. I cannot come now as it is time for my retirement. I will visit them after I retire. You must go without any objection."
Madhavan had no choice and agreed. Madhavan and Vaidehi set off for her hometown. "How beautiful they look as a couple," Madhavan’s mother said to the father.
"They look beautiful, but this is all your doing," the father replied.
"What did I do?" she asked.
"He said he didn't want marriage, but you insisted. Now you are experiencing the consequences," the father said.
"I never dreamt he would be this stubborn," the mother said.
"The Guru told us that day to leave him as he was. We should have listened," the father said.
"You were the one who said he was our only son."
"Yes, yes, not just me, you too asked the Guru to find a way, didn't you?" the father countered.
"Fine, when the marriage talk came up, why didn't you say no?"
"Between your stubbornness and his, what could I do? I remained silent," the father said.
"Well, what's done is done. What do we do now?" she asked.
"I don't understand either. This is the state of parents who don't understand their children's hearts. If children follow a righteous path, we should leave them be. If we force them, this is the result," the father said sorrowfully.
"True, we committed the sin and we are suffering. But what about Vaidehi? Poor girl, I feel pity just thinking about her," she said.
"I feel the same. I realize now what a great sin we have committed. I am retiring next month, and the thought of seeing his face every day fills me with distress," he said.
"Since you are retiring next month, may I suggest something? The day after you retire, let us go on a pilgrimage. We can stay away for two years. Let's see what happens here," the mother suggested.
"If they remain like this for two years, I will find another way. I will find a good man for Vaidehi and get her remarried to atone for our sin," the father declared.
"Will the world accept it? Is what we are doing right? You speak like this, but will Vaidehi agree?" the mother asked.
"Don't talk about 'the world.' It is because of such talk that we are in this state. If we had left him alone, this wouldn't have happened. Somehow, we must convince Vaidehi and get her married. I cannot watch a woman cry before my eyes," he said as the day passed in conversation.

Madhavan and Vaidehi arrived. When she came to see her father's remains, everyone who saw her along the way asked, "How are you? Why haven't you visited? Are you happy? You have the same smile, the same slender frame, the same beauty." She spoke graciously to everyone.
Madhavan felt a sense of unease. "She hasn't said anything. Despite me not talking to her, she mingles so well with everyone here without a care," he thought. After the funeral rites, Madhavan overheard a conversation between the mother and daughter from a distance. The mother asked, "Are you well? Do you have any troubles? You haven't visited since the wedding."
"Mother, I am very well. They look after me with great love and care. There is no lack of anything."
"Does your husband take good care of you?"
"Mother, there is no one who showers more love than him," she said.
Madhavan watched from afar, wondering why she was lying. Yet, he continued to listen. "Mother, he looks after me very lovingly. I have no grievances. I can only visit when time permits. Otherwise, I am fine in every way. None of you need to worry about me; I am peaceful and content."
Her sister-in-law asked, "Are you doing your social service there?"
"Yes, I do a lot of service, but not outside. I have enough to do at home," she replied.
Hearing this, Madhavan thought, "She speaks so highly of me, yet I haven't treated her that way. I don't know what will happen to my state of mind if I stay here. Kannan, whether what I did was right or wrong, you are important to me. I am leaving." He departed immediately.

The next morning, there was a knock on the door. Madhavan’s father opened it to find only Madhavan. "Come in, Madhava," he said, looking behind him for someone else.
Madhavan went about his morning routine.
"What, Madhava? Didn't Vaidehi come?" his mother asked.
He handed her a letter. It was from Vaidehi. "He didn't speak on the way, nor did he speak here. He just stood silently in a corner. Once all the rites were over, he said he was leaving that night. In these eighteen months, the only word he spoke was 'I am leaving.' It hurts deeply. Since Mother is alone here, I will stay with her for a while and return before my father-in-law retires. Do not worry about me. Take care of your health."
Madhavan’s mother gave the letter to the father and went back to her work. Madhavan engaged in his puja as if nothing had happened. The father sat in silence after reading the letter.

The time for the father's retirement arrived. Since Vaidehi had written that she was coming, the mother went to fetch her. Both returned.
The father retired. He called Madhavan and said, "As I mentioned, all my settlement money has arrived. I am going to send some to our Guru. The rest, I will handle as I said before."
Madhavan simply muttered "Hmm" without emotion.
"Your mother and I are leaving for a pilgrimage tomorrow morning."
Startled, Madhavan asked, "Who will be here then?"
"Why, you are here, and Vaidehi is here," the father said.
After a moment's thought, Madhavan said, "You could go a bit later."
"No, Madhava, I am unable to. I am aging, so I think it's right to go now."
"Will you return soon?"
"What, Madhava? Are we small children or youths? We must travel slowly and see every town. Don't worry about us; I will write letters occasionally."
"Fine, do as you wish," Madhavan said and went to the puja room. "Kannan! What is this new confusion? Why are they taking revenge on me like this? Whatever happens, your vision is what matters. I don't care who is here or who isn't. I will not waver from my resolve. You must protect me in this situation," he prayed and left for his shop.

Madhavan’s mother told Vaidehi, "At least now, try to understand him and act accordingly, dear. It is to atone for our sins that we are going to bathe in all the holy rivers and pray for you. You too must conduct yourself well."
"Mother, he doesn't even speak to me. How can I understand and act?" she asked.
"Everything will be fine in a few days. Kannan will bless us," the mother said.
All day, the parents gave advice to Vaidehi. She was terrified inside. She pleaded with Kannan, "Kannan, what sin did I commit? Such a husband, such a house. I am even afraid to speak to him. You must give me courage until they return. In my current state of mind, I understand nothing. I am afraid of what might happen. You must save me."
Everyone in the house was filled with fear and anxiety about what was to come. The father was determined to go. Kannan, watching everything, was smiling.

The next day dawned. The parents prepared to leave. Madhavan was in his puja. "We are leaving," they said.
"Fine," said Madhavan.
"Go safely. If your health fails, return immediately. Write letters often," Vaidehi said, her eyes filled with tears and her heart heavy. She prepared to cook for Madhavan. She fearfully finished the cooking and placed the food offering (naivedyam) at the door of the puja room. Madhavan took it, finished the puja, and sat down to eat in silence. Vaidehi served breakfast, wondering if it was good or if he would say anything, as she had followed her mother-in-law's instructions. Madhavan ate without any emotion. The thought that another soul was watching him didn't even register. After eating, he took his lunch and left. He didn't say if it was enough or if it was good. He didn't say he was leaving. He just checked if lunch was ready, took it, and went. Two or three months passed this way.

Letters would come from the parents to both Madhavan and Vaidehi. Madhavan never spoke of his letters to her. Vaidehi wanted to speak of hers but remained silent out of fear. A letter came from Vaidehi’s mother asking her to come to her hometown. Vaidehi was in a dilemma. How could she ask Madhavan? She thought, "He doesn't speak anyway; I might as well go home." One morning, after he finished his puja, she said, "Mother has written asking me to come to the village."
Madhavan placed the travel money and expenses where she could see them and left without a word.

Vaidehi cried to Kannan, "Kannan, couldn't he have said 'go' or 'don't go'? Will there be no salvation for me? Everyone asks why we have no children. Can I explain the situation here? Lord, why this punishment? Am I a great sinner? Will my life always be like this? I stand alone; are you blind too? Kannan, I am being sacrificed for someone else's sin. He has left money telling me to go; you are the witness. I am taking the money." Vaidehi took her clothes, locked the house, and gave the key at the shop herself. Even when she gave the key, he didn't say "Goodbye," "When will you return?" or "Come back soon."
Madhavan rejoiced, thinking, "Only me and Kannan, no one else. I will do much for Kannan and cry for his vision." This became the routine. Vaidehi began visiting her relatives. If she spent one month at Madhavan’s house, she spent two months traveling elsewhere. Madhavan was at peace; Vaidehi wandered like a madwoman. Two years passed this way. Nothing changed. The parents returned and learned everything. Another year passed in the same confusion. The parents were deeply grieved. "It seems God will not open his eyes for us," they lamented.
