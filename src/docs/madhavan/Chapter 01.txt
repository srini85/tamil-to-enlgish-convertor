There lived a mother and father who were of good character and charitable mind. They had a son, about 7 years old, named Madhavan. Like other children, he was mischievous and full of youthful energy. At times, he could also be quite stubborn. This family had a great Mahatma (Sage) as their Guru. The Sage was not old, but middle-aged.

One day, news arrived that the Mahatma was coming to their house. Elaborate preparations took place at home. Madhavan did not understand what was happening; he went to his mother and asked, "What is the special occasion?"

"Madhav, our Guru is coming," she said. "Who is a Guru? Why should he come here?" he asked. "Don't bother me, ask your father," she replied.

He asked his father the same question: "Who is a Guru?" The father, who was engaged in very important work, found it difficult to make him understand. Thinking he should say something simple, he explained temporarily: "An uncle with a beard will come to our house. He has seen Kannan (Lord Krishna) in person. If we all worship him, Kannan will come before us."

Madhavan began wandering inside and outside the house, frequently looking at the entrance. He thought to himself, "When will this bearded uncle come? I must ask him how Kannan looks. Will Kannan come to play with me? It would be great if this bearded uncle brought Kannan along! How will that Kannan be? I long to play with him." He was struggling with this deep yearning in his heart.

Finally, the Mahatma arrived at their house. All the elders performed Pada Puja (ceremonial washing of feet) and offered hospitalities. Inside, Madhavan felt irritated. "All the elders are going to him, but they won't let me near that bearded uncle! This bearded uncle is also disappointing; he isn't noticing me. They are all talking about something or other, but no one is asking about Kannan! Is it only people like this that the bearded uncle invites? He refuses to see me," he grumbled in his mind.

When the ceremonies were over, everyone returned to their homes. The Mahatma went to rest. Madhavan, thinking this was his chance, followed behind him. Madhavan's mother saw him and said, "Madhavan, let the Guru rest. He has come from so far away. Today, you must control your mischief and stay quiet. You haven't eaten anything since morning—come and eat."

The Guru looked at Madhavan and said, "Go and eat, child." "No, I don't want anything," Madhavan replied. Understanding his intent, the Guru said, "I will take you alone this evening. We can go to the temple and play in the park there. Now, go and eat." He then went to rest.

"I don't want any food," Madhavan told his mother. He sat silently on the doorstep and thought, "It seems they won't let me find out about Kannan! Food, they say—food! What if I don't eat for one day? Why does this bearded uncle need rest? What if he speaks to me for just ten minutes? He talks about everything unnecessary, but won't say what is needed!"

His mother called again, "Come to eat!" "Alright, let's go eat; I am hungry too. The bearded uncle said he would meet me in the evening, I can ask him then," he said to himself and went to eat.

Later, the Mahatma and Madhavan walked toward the temple. The Mahatma asked Madhavan about his studies and friends. Madhavan gave reluctant answers. They reached the temple of Krishna, finished their Darshan (viewing), and sat in the park. Madhavan looked at the Mahatma and said, "Bearded uncle, I like you very much."

"Very well, child. You play while I perform my prayers (Japam)," he said. Madhavan went to pluck a beautiful flower. The Mahatma immediately stopped him: "Don't pluck the flower; it is meant to decorate Krishna."

Seeing his chance, Madhavan ran to him and asked, "Bearded uncle, have you seen Kannan?" "Why do you have such a doubt, child?" "Will Kannan come with me?" "He will surely come. If you call him with faith, he will come." "What if I call and he doesn't come?" "We should never think that way at any time. One day, he will surely come and play with you." "Fine, how will Kannan look?" "He will be a mischievous boy just like you." "I must definitely see him, Uncle!" "Don't worry. Keep thinking of him. Don't neglect your studies! You must keep studying, and at the same time, keep him in your thoughts within you."

"Will he really come, Uncle? Can I believe your words?" "He will surely come. Be faithful as I said. No matter what weakness comes, do not give up your faith. He will definitely come to see you. Now come, the work we came for is finished. Let's go."

"How did you know I was going to ask all this? You say the work is finished!" The Mahatma smiled to himself and began to walk. "Lord, I have planted the seed. Now you must pour water, make it a plant, then a tree, and let it bear flowers and fruit. This is your doing," he prayed silently as they walked home.

The Mahatma stayed that night and left the next morning. He called everyone and said, "I am going on a pilgrimage. I will travel on foot to many sacred places. I will stay in various towns and give teachings. Finally, I will establish an ashram in a town and settle there. Then, you can all come and meet me. I'm leaving now. Madhavan, I am going." He took his leave.

The next day, as Madhavan prepared for school, he asked, "Amma, the bearded uncle said Kannan would come. Will he really come, Amma?" "Whatever the bearded uncle says will happen. Kannan will surely come. Don't worry, go to school," she said. She did not realize how deeply those words had settled in his mind; she thought he was asking out of playfulness.

In the evening, the moment Madhavan returned from school, his first question was, "Did Kannan come?" "Kannan will surely come. You go and play," she said.

This continued every day. Every day he asked if Kannan had come. He would even wake up in the middle of sleep and ask why Kannan hadn't arrived yet. While going to school, he would suddenly turn back to look. He stopped playing games and pined for Krishna. Eventually, he lost interest in everything. His parents were at a loss.

As days passed, Madhavan began asking everyone he saw if Kannan would come. He wandered like someone possessed. His parents' grief grew. Madhavan stopped eating and sleeping properly and eventually became bedridden. He stubbornly refused to eat until Kannan arrived. He grew thin and weak. Doctors came and went, saying that only "that Kannan" could heal him. Madhavan told his mother, "Amma, I will not open my eyes. Until that Kannan comes, I will not open them!" His mother's heart broke.

Two days passed without him eating or opening his eyes. His mother went to the local Krishna temple, crying her heart out. The priest asked, "Is your child still not well?" "No, sir. That Krishna himself must answer for this. He must answer whether the boy will live or not!" she sobbed.

Suddenly, a hand touched her shoulder. A middle-aged woman, looking very beautiful and auspicious like Goddess Lakshmi, was standing there. "What is the matter, mother? Why are you crying?" she asked. Madhavan's mother explained everything.

"Is that all? Come, let us go see Madhavan," the woman said. She picked up a bag she had kept nearby and they set off. On the way, the mother asked, "Who are you? You have come to help me in my grief."

"Me? My name is Thayaramma. My husband stays in different towns, and I travel from town to town behind him. Don't worry about me. Let's see your son."

They entered the house. The mother said, "Madhavan, look who is here. Open your eyes." "Tell me if Kannan has come, otherwise I won't." "Aha! What stubbornness at this age! You are acting like a child who knows nothing!" the woman said, sitting beside him and stroking his head. Madhavan thought, "Who could this be? She speaks so beautifully. Should I open my eyes? No, not until Kannan comes."

"Madhavan, I have come only because Kannan told me to. Look at me," Thayaramma said. "Kannan told you?" He opened his eyes in surprise. Looking at her, he felt that everything she said must be true.

Thayaramma said, "Our Kannan sent me. He asked me to see you and tell you a few things. That is why I ran here. And here you are, sitting without eating! He gave me something to give to you." She began to feed him Prasad (consecrated food).

Madhavan ate without a word. Halfway through, he asked, "How will Kannan look?" "He is very beautiful. He captivates everyone's heart," she said. "Did he say he would come to see me?" "He never abandons those who believe in him. He won't abandon you either. He will surely come." "Then why hasn't he come yet?" "He gave me an answer for that. He said, 'A stubborn boy is waiting for me. I have a lot of work and many devotees are coming. Tell him I will run to him as soon as I get some rest.' So he will surely come, don't worry, Madhavan!"

Madhavan asked, "Is Kannan older than you?" "Our Kannan is greater than the great, and smaller than the small. He is smaller than you, and greater than me," she smiled. "Why say 'our' Kannan? Say 'my' Kannan," Madhavan corrected. "Since I, you, and your mother are here, I said 'our' Kannan. Fine, let him be yours. Shall I leave now?"

Madhavan’s mother said, "Amma, you came like a deity and saved my child. I am so grateful. It has been so long since he smiled or ate. By your grace, he has opened his eyes. Please give him some good advice before you go."

Thayaramma smiled. "The command given to me was to see him. There is no need for thanks; everything belongs to the Lord. Madhavan, you must be a good boy. Study well and stop being stubborn. Because you will be good, I will give you something." "I will surely listen to you, Amma." "It is enough if that Kannan comes to you. Until then, I give you this. This is the idol (Vigraham) I worship daily." She handed him a one-foot-tall idol of Krishna. "If you want to see Kannan, look at this idol. Keep it very safely. For now, imagine that Kannan is right here. Shall I go now, Madhavan?"

Madhavan walked her to the door. He stood with the idol, watching her until she reached the end of the street. Thayaramma walked on, smiling. "Lord, I have watered the seed. Now the rest is your work."

Madhavan looked at the path she took. "How good she is! She has seen Kannan! Look, she even gave me Kannan's 'doll'!" "Madhavan, you shouldn't keep the idol in your hand like that. Place it in our puja room," his mother said. Madhavan placed it in a good spot and frequently went to touch and look at it.

"You haven't been to school for ten days. Go to your friend's house and get the books," his mother said. "Alright Amma, I'll be back soon. Until then, you look after Kannan!" On the way, he saw his father. "Appa! Appa! Kannan has come! Go home and see! I'll be right back!" he shouted and ran.

The father entered the house in surprise. The mother explained everything and showed him the idol. "Because this Kannan came, our Madhavan survived. We are indebted to him. From tomorrow, you must bathe this Kannan, offer flowers, and keep this room divine. I will offer food with devotion twice a day."

Madhavan ran back home. "Appa, did you see my Kannan?" "I saw him, Madhavan. You must study well now. Kannan is with us now. Be a good boy, or he will leave." Madhavan smiled. "Appa, this is not Kannan; it's a doll. But a lady said if I keep this, the real Kannan will surely come." "Fine, as you wish. If you are a boy of good character and discipline, that Kannan will come to see you."

Night came. Madhavan asked his parents, "Can I sleep today where Kannan is?" "No, child, you are small, you might get scared." "No, I will sleep right here, near my Kannan." "Alright, as you wish," they said.

Madhavan lay down. After a while, he got up. "I am lying down, but you are just standing there. Lie down!" he told the idol. Checking to see if his parents were watching, he laid the idol down next to him. "No, if Amma and Appa see, they will say I'm not a good boy. Then you might not come," he said, and placed the idol back in its spot. "Kanna, you must come. I will wait for you," he whispered and fell asleep with a small yearning.

The next morning, earlier than usual, the father woke Madhavan and bathed him. Then the father bathed and came to wash the idol. "Appa, are you going to bathe my Kannan too? Can I do it?" "No, you are small. I must bathe you first. You cannot wash the idol yet. You can do it when you are older. Now, get ready for school."
