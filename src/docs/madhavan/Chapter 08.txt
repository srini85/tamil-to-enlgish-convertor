Vaidehi finished her chores and entered Krishna’s room to see Madhavan. He was busy sorting the earnings from the shop to pay off their various debts. Seeing this, Vaidehi worried about the small loans she had taken from the neighbors and wondered how to ask him for the money.

When Madhavan saw her, he said, "Come in, Vaidehi."

Vaidehi stood frozen, wondering if she was dreaming or awake. Is he actually calling out to me like this? she wondered. She slowly sat beside him and whispered, "I have also borrowed a little money from the neighbors."

Madhavan immediately replied, "Then use this to pay your debts first, Vaidehi. You shouldn't have to stand ashamed before others."

"No, no," she insisted. "Pay your business debts first. You shouldn't have to bow your head to anyone but Krishna. I can manage with the neighbors for a bit longer."

Madhavan looked at her in surprise. Is this really Vaidehi speaking? he thought. "Let's divide the money and see how much we have," he said. After calculating, they realized they had enough to clear both their debts and still have money left over to buy new stock for the shop. They both shared a spontaneous laugh—the first true moment of shared joy in that house. For Vaidehi, life finally felt meaningful.

That evening, as Madhavan began the puja, Vaidehi arranged everything he needed. The day ended peacefully. The next morning, when Madhavan returned from his bath, he was astonished to find all the ritual items for the Abhishekam and the food offerings (Naivedyam) already prepared. Vaidehi was sitting in the room with her eyes closed in meditation. Her face glowed with a newfound strength.

After the morning prayers, Vaidehi asked softly, "May I sing a song for Krishna?" "Sing, Vaidehi," he replied. She sang a beautiful, soul-stirring song. Madhavan was captivated. "Your singing is wonderful. You must sing before our Krishna every morning," he said.

"Because you were nearby, Krishna gave me the courage, and the song came naturally," she replied. "Your wish is my wish. I will sing before our Krishna every day." Madhavan felt a surge of happiness hearing her refer to the deity as "our" Krishna.

From that day on, their routine changed. Vaidehi suggested that instead of staying at the shop all day, Madhavan should come home for lunch. "I will keep the food hot. You can come, offer it to Krishna, and then eat. That way, you get to spend more time with Him," she said. Madhavan agreed.

One afternoon, Vaidehi suggested, "Every evening after the prayers, you should tell me a story of Krishna. Shall we start today?" "Certainly," Madhavan replied. "It will keep our minds from wandering and keep us immersed in pure devotion." He decided to tell her the story of Bhakt Meera. He described Meera's intense longing and how she described Krishna’s beauty.

Listening to him, Vaidehi was moved to tears. He has become like Meera himself while describing Him, she thought. Kanna, why do you test such a pure soul? I will never let his devotion go to waste. I am content just to serve the two of you. I no longer desire a worldly life.

As the days passed, Vaidehi took on more responsibilities. She suggested, "I have nothing to do in the afternoons. Why don't you stay home and do your prayers (Japa) while I look after the shop? You will have more time with Krishna." Madhavan taught her the business, and soon they shared the duties—Madhavan in the morning and Vaidehi in the afternoon.

One day, Vaidehi's brother visited. He had come to invite them to a family wedding. Madhavan greeted him, but Vaidehi felt a sense of unease. When Madhavan offered to show him the Krishna idol and explain his devotion, Vaidehi quickly intervened, making excuses about having to get to the shop.

Later, after the brother left, Madhavan was silent and distant. Vaidehi fell at his feet, weeping. "Please forgive me. I didn't stop you because I don't value your devotion. I did it because my brother is a worldly man. He wouldn't understand. He might act polite to your face, but he would mock you behind your back or write letters criticizing us. I cannot bear to see even a speck of dust fall on your reputation. For people like him, 'devotion' is just a mask to get what they want from God. They have no desire to actually 'see' Him. I don't need those relatives. My only relationship is with you and my service to Krishna."

Madhavan moved her to stand up. "Vaidehi, you have understood me more deeply than I understood you. I have no worldly experience; I have only known Krishna. From now on, I will never doubt you. You are like a mother and a Guru to me."

"No," she stopped him. "I am forever your servant."

The couple continued their life in pure devotion. Vaidehi took over the financial management and the shop's responsibilities, ensuring Madhavan could pursue his spiritual path without distraction. They began sending a monthly contribution to their Guru’s ashram, and despite their spiritual focus, their wealth began to grow. Their life became a journey of pure, undisturbed faith.
