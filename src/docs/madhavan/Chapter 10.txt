One night, after completing the rituals and placing Kannan in the cradle, Madhavan sank into deep meditation. Lost in that state, he lost track of time. A long while must have passed when a profound voice resonated from somewhere. Vaidehi was singing a song she had written, describing Kannan from Radha’s perspective. Forgetting his own surroundings, Madhavan rose and walked toward the direction of the voice, entering Vaidehi’s room. In truth, unable to sleep, Vaidehi had been composing a song for her historical chronicle of Kannan, where Radha describes Him, and was singing it to herself. Fearing that if she stopped, her husband—who had approached her in a trance—would have his meditation broken, she continued to sing. Unconsciously, Madhavan reached out and took Vaidehi’s hand. Though confused, Vaidehi kept singing. Both forgot themselves and merged into one. This was not a union born of lust; they were lost in the depths of devotion. It was a bond forged in their previous births; thus, here, the natural bond of destiny stood superior to carnal desire.

This does not happen to everyone. If such a bond truly exists, it transforms into a divine connection. This is what is meant when it is said that the Rishis of old were "infatuated." In reality, they were not infatuated; rather, when two poles of devotion stand at their peak, the bonds created by time cause them to blend and become one. To view this as a flaw is itself a flaw. Vaidehi suddenly startled and rose. Madhavan was still not in his normal state of consciousness. Realizing what had transpired, Vaidehi began to weep. "O Lord, I once desired this long ago, and is the fruit of that desire manifesting only now? I had forgotten all that and remained in service at your feet!"

"Why did you give me this pleasure now? I have tarnished him. Will he remain with me? Where will he go? I cannot live for a single moment separated from him. Our devotion was so pure and peaceful; why did you change it so? Is this the punishment for the petty desire I once held? What will happen when he wakes?" she thought, weeping in various ways.

Madhavan slowly rose and sat up. He realized where he was and what had happened. He wept silently within his heart. "Kanna, I was thinking only of you; what has happened to me? Why did you let me get trapped like this? What am I to achieve by living hereafter? I will not even be able to see you now. I am not fortunate enough to behold you. The penance I performed for so long has gone to waste. Must I continue to live? I shall live no longer. I have also tarnished Vaidehi, who is supreme in her devotion. How can I look upon her face again? This life is no longer needed," he decided and stood up.

Madhavan rose, thinking it better to leave than to stay. But as he tried to take a step, he could not, for Vaidehi was clutching his feet, weeping. "What I did was a mistake; please do not leave me and go anywhere," she cried. "I cannot live without you. Please listen to what I say. This happened without our knowledge. There is no impurity in my heart. I was singing of Kannan with all my soul, and even now, I am thinking only of Him. Long ago, I had such thoughts, but certainly not now. My heart truly aches. It is because of me that you face all this hardship. It is better that I die than remain alive," she lamented.

"Rise, Vaidehi. You are not at fault. I am the one who erred. I am the one who should be punished. It is not you, but I, who must face the consequences," Madhavan said. "It is because of me that your focus on Kannan was broken. I am unworthy of living. I wonder if Kannan will ever grant me his vision again."

"Do not let such words cross your lips again. Kannan will surely grant you his vision. You have committed no wrong," Vaidehi insisted.

"No, Vaidehi. For a moment, I forgot everything, did I not? Am I even a devotee?"

"Are you, who knows everything, speaking like this? This happened when you had forgotten yourself; does that not mean it was not done by you? A power higher than both of us has made this happen. Your pure devotion will never be destroyed. There was no lust in your thoughts. How could lust, which was absent for so long, appear now? Kannan himself has orchestrated this drama without our knowledge. He will reveal the reason for it. Why should we make a hasty decision? I am not a sage to advise you; I am but the dust at your feet. Please understand. This will certainly not happen again, nor will I allow it to happen. From this day forward, Kannan is my first child, and you are my second child. This is an oath upon the Kannan I worship," Vaidehi said passionately.

Madhavan was bewildered. Resigning himself to the idea that whatever happens hereafter is Kannan’s will, he surrendered to Him. As dawn began to break, he said he was going to bathe. Walking toward the river, he sat and reflected. "Kanna, will I be considered a sinner? How did I, who remained steadfast in my resolve for so long, forget in an instant? No matter how much I think, this does not seem like my own doing. Kanna, did you do this to unite us? Or did you fulfill the desire Vaidehi once held? If you show her such grace, should you not grant me your vision? Do not trap me in this web of illusion again. We both wish to reach you only through pure devotion. I pray to you with all my heart. Do not create this situation again; let this be the last time." After bathing well, he returned home and looked toward Kannan’s room. Kannan appeared with the same radiance and enthusiasm as always.

Seeing no change, he gazed intently at Kannan and saw that He was smiling. With excitement, he shouted, "My Kannan has not left me, Vaidehi! Our Kannan will not leave us!" Vaidehi rejoiced seeing her husband smile. "Let us forget what happened as if it were a dream and look toward the future," she said.

"Yes, Vaidehi. There is no use dwelling on the past. We must ensure it does not happen again. We shall conduct ourselves so that such an incident never recurs." Both participated in the day’s prayers together. As usual, the days rolled by.

Govindan, claiming his mother had passed away and he had no one else, began staying with them. A flower garden behind the house became available at a low price. Using some money Vaidehi had saved and the profits from the business, she bought the garden for Madhavan, as it was his wish. She also made a path leading to the garden directly from the back of their house.

If Madhavan went through the back path, he would reach the other side of the river where no one else would be. He could bathe there in peace. Everything was convenient now. Though they tried to forget the incident, Vaidehi could not, for she was pregnant. She hesitated, wondering how to tell Madhavan. "I shall consider this as Kannan’s love. I will take full responsibility and look after everything myself; I will not involve you in any trouble," she said, and thus obtained Madhavan’s consent. The child was born under the Rohini star on the Ashtami Tithi. The child was beautiful and captivated everyone. Since the "Big Kannan" was already in the house, they named him "Kutti Kannan" (Little Kannan). He performed all the mischievous acts that Kannan was known for. Vaidehi took full responsibility for raising him.

There was no change in Madhavan; he remained as before, immersed in his prayers. With Govindan’s help, Vaidehi managed everything. Kutti Kannan was now six years old. Vaidehi raised him to be a good child, a great devotee like his father, and a person of excellent character. His mischief and his speech left them in awe. For a long time, the town did not even know of Madhavan and Vaidehi’s presence, but through the boy, they became well-known.

One day, Vaidehi came to Madhavan and said, "You used to be at a Krishna temple in another town when you were young. Everyone says that temple has been renovated and is being maintained beautifully now. I feel a desire for you to go and see it."

"What is this sudden thought, Vaidehi? Are we to leave our own Kannan and go?" Madhavan asked.

"No, something just occurred to me. That is the town where you first found Kannan, isn't it? It has been a long time since you went there. From what everyone says, it seems it would be wonderful. If you see it and describe it to me, wouldn't that be lovely?"

"Fine, I shall go. But you have to look after the shop, look after Kannan, and also look after Kutti Kannan. How will you manage?"

"Finish the morning prayers for Kannan and then leave. I will perform the afternoon and evening prayers. You will be back by night. Govindan will look after the shop. There will be no problem," she said.

"Alright, I will leave tomorrow morning," he said. The next morning, after completing his usual prayers, Madhavan set out. Vaidehi prepared everything he needed. Just as he was about to leave, a voice called out, "Appa!" It was Kutti Kannan.

"What is it?" Madhavan asked.

"Father is going to a temple, do not disturb him," Vaidehi said.

"Which temple?" the boy asked.

"He is going to the place where your elder brother, the Big Kannan, used to be," she replied.

"I want to see where my brother was too!" he insisted stubbornly. Vaidehi did not know what to do and looked at Madhavan. "He is only asking to come to Kannan’s temple. I will take him along. Let his devotion grow from this age," Madhavan said.

Vaidehi could say nothing more. Looking at Kutti Kannan, she said, "Go and come back, Kanna. Bring Father back safely."

"I will look after Father; you look after my brother properly," the boy replied.

The father and son arrived at the temple in that town. Someone at the temple asked, "You are Madhavan, aren't you?"

Surprised that someone remembered him so well, Madhavan looked closely and said, "You are Krishnan, aren't you? You studied with me!"

"Yes, yes, the same Krishnan. I look after the temple now. Are you still in that same devotion to Kannan? Haven't you changed at all?" Krishnan asked.

"Not at all, he is exactly the same," Kutti Kannan chimed in.

After having a vision of the deity, Madhavan went to see the place where he used to ask his Guru questions. The garden there was well-maintained and beautiful. The stone they used to sit on was still there. He sat on that stone and sat his son beside him. "This is where I asked our Guru some questions when I was your age," Madhavan said.

"This place is beautiful and wonderful, Appa. We should make our back garden just like this," Kutti Kannan said.

"I am telling you one thing, and you are saying another. Fine, you play here while I perform my meditation." Madhavan sank so deeply into his meditation that he did not realize how time passed. When he opened his eyes, it was evening. Remembering he had to return to his Kannan, he forgot everything else and set out. He completely forgot that Kutti Kannan was with him.

He arrived home. Vaidehi opened the door. "How is Kannan? How was the temple? Describe it to me," she said. She, too, did not remember that the child had not returned. "They have changed it according to the times and convenience. But that Kannan remains the same." Madhavan went on describing how he used to decorate that Kannan in his childhood and the things he used to imagine. Vaidehi listened intently.

Govindan was in a panic. He didn't know where the child was. He wondered why even the mother hadn't asked. Both were talking only about Kannan. Had they left the child somewhere? He couldn't understand anything and was desperate to ask. Seeing Vaidehi and Madhavan sitting silently for a moment, he thought this was the time and asked, "Where is the child?"

Vaidehi looked at Madhavan and asked, "Where is Kutti Kannan?"

"Yes, Kutti Kannan was right here... where is he?" Madhavan asked.

"He is not here; he went with you," Govindan said.

Only then did Madhavan remember everything—meeting his childhood friend and making the boy sit there. He told Vaidehi everything and mentioned how he sat for meditation and then just got up and came straight back. Realizing what had happened, Vaidehi understood that he had left the child behind.

"Vaidehi, forgive me. I have left your child behind," Madhavan said.

"Why do you speak like this? He is not 'my' child; he is Kannan’s child. If he is meant to come here, he will surely come. Or if he is meant to grow up with someone else, he will stay there. Whatever judgment Kannan gives, we must accept it."

"What, Vaidehi? As a mother, does your heart not feel any panic?" he asked. Govindan also looked on in amazement.

"Certainly not," she said. "I have been a devotee alongside you for so long. That day He gave me pleasure, and I accepted it. Today He does this, and I accept this too. That Kannan gave me that child; let Him do as He wishes." In her heart, she thought, *For a couple of days, the heart that gave birth will grieve a little. But you, my elder son, are here, so even that grief will be forgotten. This pain is also natural. Just as I experienced those two minutes of pleasure unknowingly, this pain comes the same way.* She prostrated before Madhavan and Kannan and said, "Come, let us eat."

Madhavan thought, *What is this? She invites me to eat and says Kannan will look after everything. If I had this much determination and faith back then, none of this would have happened, would it? Kanna, are you teaching me a lesson through my wife? Back then, I could not bear to be separated from my parents, but she is willing to be separated even from her own child to show devotion to you. Is she not the superior devotee? I have learned a good lesson.*

Meanwhile, Vaidehi said, "What are you thinking? Did Devaki not remain separated from Kannan? Even knowing that God was born as her child, did she not part with Him the very moment He was born? At least I have raised him until he was six before being separated. This will not be a permanent separation; Kannan will surely bring him back. Come."

"Amma, you both may be able to stay without the child, but I will not be able to sleep. My heart is in pain and distress. You have helped me so much and looked after me like a son. I cannot stay without Kutti Kannan. I will go to that town and search for him. Give me some money," Govindan said.

"Alright, Govinda. You are showing your gratitude for the salt you have eaten. Here, take the money," Vaidehi said and sent him off.

Govindan caught the last cart and reached the town at night. Upon arriving, he didn't know where to go. He remembered hearing that a rest house (choultry) had been built at the Kannan temple. Thinking he would stay there for the night and search for Kutti Kannan in the morning, he headed toward the temple. He sat near the temple rest house. Seeing a raised platform (pinnai) by the temple gate, he decided to sleep there and began to think. "Kanna, somehow find Kutti Kannan and give him back to me. I will not return home without him. Moreover, those who show such devotion to you should not suffer in any way. Their name should not be tarnished because of their devotion to you. You must do this favor for me. Somehow give Kutti Kannan back, otherwise, there is no meaning in being devoted to you. I came here believing you would surely help. I don't know how to pray like them. If I find Kutti Kannan, I will serve you for the rest of my life. All I want is that no trouble should come to them. Somehow find him and give him back," he prayed in his mind. Suddenly, a thought struck him—perhaps Kutti Kannan was at that Krishnan’s house. He could search there in the morning. *If he is there, what reason should I give to bring him back? I must speak without exposing my master’s mistake. Give me an idea for that too,* he thought, and eventually fell asleep.

In the morning, as the sun hit his face, he woke up. As he prayed, "Kanna, I must find Kutti Kannan," he felt someone shaking him. He opened his eyes and could not contain his surprise. It was Kutti Kannan who had woken him up.

"Govinda Anna! Why are you sleeping here? Did Appa send you?" the boy asked.

"Yes, Appa sent me just for you," he replied.

"Kutti Kanna, who is this?" asked a man who approached them.

"He is my uncle, Mama. He stays at our house and shop. He is my elder brother and a very good man. Appa sent him for me," Kutti Kannan said.

Hearing Kutti Kannan’s words, Govindan was overjoyed. Furthermore, the boy’s words gave him the answer he needed. "The father of the Kutti Kannan who came with you yesterday had to return to town urgently for some work. Thinking the boy was with you, he went back, and as soon as he reached, he sent me to fetch Kutti Kannan," Govindan explained.

"Alright, come, bathe, eat, and then you can leave," Krishnan said, taking them along. Govindan was immensely happy that Kutti Kannan was found, and even more so that he had protected his master’s honor. *The cause for all this is that Kannan. O God, I have understood who you are. What could be more precious in this world than you? Who else could it be? You are the one who listens to a just plea. I must always serve your holy feet. I didn't realize it before, but I do now. Kanna, accept me as your servant too. You must always bless my service. I will stay with them until Kutti Kannan grows up. Once he reaches a good position and takes over responsibility, I will dedicate my life to you. I will visit all the holy sites in my lifetime and then serve the devotees. This is the vow I take today,* he thought as he looked toward the temple tower.

Krishnan looked at Govindan and said, "Come, let's go." Govindan, with resolve in his heart, set out.
