One day, Madhavan’s father watched him leave for the shop. Once Madhavan had gone, he called out to Vaidehi. "Vaidehi, my daughter, his condition remains like this. We have prayed to every deity imaginable, yet I do not know what to do. I have only one suggestion left."

Vaidehi looked at her father-in-law with a look of surprise. He continued, "Do not take what I am about to say the wrong way. Times are changing, and we must change as well. I cannot bear to see you in this state anymore. Therefore, I am thinking of finding a good man for you and seeing you married again. I only need your consent. Do not worry about anything else."

Bowing to him, she said, "Thank you very much, father. It is my great fortune to have found such a wonderful father-in-law and mother-in-law. Even if he is not truly with me, I will serve both of you for as long as you live. I cannot marry another man."

"Why, daughter? Are you afraid of society? Leave that worry to me," said Madhavan’s father.

"Certainly not, father. If my husband were someone who wandered with other women or was a man of ruined character, I would have surely cast everyone aside and remarried. But that is not the case here. My husband is a great devotee, a man of firm resolve and pure thoughts. Wherever I go, he provides me with financial help. It is by some stroke of fate that we are in this situation. Whether we will truly unite or not is up to Kannan. I shall remain here as your daughter until the end," she said, tears streaming down her face.

"I admire your noble thoughts, daughter. I will deposit the sum we have kept for you in the bank. You will receive a monthly amount for your expenses; keep that. You may go wherever you wish, whenever you want. Even if my son were to leave you one day, you would have this amount to sustain yourself. This small sum is all I can manage, daughter—perhaps a penance for some sin I committed. There is a small piece of land in the village where I used to live; I shall register it in your name. Your mother-in-law does not know of this yet; it is something I earned before my marriage. I will give you all the details soon. I shall register this house in Madhavan’s name, daughter."

Madhavan’s mother, who had been listening to this, said, "My parents gave me only a few pieces of jewelry. I shall give those to you as well, as penance for the sin I have committed," and they moved away.

Vaidehi went to Kannan’s room. "Kanna, did I ask you for land or jewelry? My husband is not affectionate with me; he has never spoken to me. Will he not look at me even for a single day? Let him show even a fraction of the love he has for you toward me. That would be enough; I would spend my entire life with just that."

Many days passed in this manner. Madhavan’s father fell ill. Because his mind was troubled, his physical health declined. Many treatments were sought, and many expenses were incurred. Madhavan took loans from the shops where he bought his supplies to provide medical care for his father. Seeing the father bedridden, the mother also fell ill. He spent money on both his father and mother alternately.

Vaidehi sold the land that had been given to her and brought the money. Madhavan did not ask a single word about where the money came from. Without saying anything to Madhavan, Vaidehi spent it all on their medical expenses.

Madhavan’s father passed away. Vaidehi sold all her jewelry to continue the treatment for Madhavan’s mother. She even borrowed money from known sources for the treatment. But what medicine is there for a troubled mind? Madhavan’s mother also passed away. Ten years had passed since their marriage, yet there was no change in their lives. Now, there was debt. Vaidehi managed the household responsibilities with the money that had been set aside for her. Because there was no stock in the shop, Madhavan had not opened it for three days.

He asked Kannan, "Kanna, how many responsibilities are you placing on my head? If I ask for your vision, you give me all this as news. Do whatever you will," and he sat in silence before Kannan. Vaidehi was astonished; he hadn't even asked how she would manage the household responsibilities! She suffered, unable to understand if he would ever change or if he would continue like this forever.

In the afternoon, after having his meal, Madhavan sat in Kannan’s room. Vaidehi was busy with household chores. Hearing a knock at the door, she opened it. Two people were standing there. "What is it? What do you want?" she asked.

"Is the master of the house in?" asked one of the men.
"He is resting. Tell me what it is," she replied.
"It is nothing. He said he would give the money this coming Saturday."
"It is only Thursday today; Saturday is yet to come," she said.
"I am in urgent need of money, mother. Please tell him to give it on Saturday without fail. I came to remind him. Since he wasn't at the shop, I came here," they said and left.

Bolting the door, Vaidehi came inside and saw Madhavan in the room where Kannan was. Madhavan was in deep prayer as if nothing had happened. "Why is he sitting like a statue? He doesn't even know who came. If he sits like this, how will he give the money by Saturday? How can I tell him they came asking for money? I have also taken other loans; how can I tell him that? Only if he speaks can some decision be made. Kanna, I feel like I am going mad. He could at least go to the shop properly. Kanna, he has left the shop and is sitting like this; can't you at least give him some sense? As if the existing pain wasn't enough, it is increasing now. What should I do, Lord? You have placed me in such a dilemma. If at least my father-in-law or mother-in-law were here, I could have managed. I am here like a helpless orphan. Have mercy at least for my sake, Kanna. I have been weeping for ten years; why have you not shown mercy yet?" She spent the rest of the day thinking of various things and eventually fell asleep without knowing when.

At dawn on Friday, Madhavan bathed and went to perform puja for Kannan. Vaidehi went about her work, worrying about where to find the money to pay the debt the next day. Madhavan was immersed in puja without any worry.

Around eight in the morning, there was another knock at the door. Fearing it might be a creditor, Vaidehi opened the door. To her surprise, a couple stood there smiling. They were beautiful and captivating. Vaidehi did not know who they were, but seeing them brought her a sense of strength and joy. She felt an immense affection for them and stood there in awe, staring at them.

The woman of the couple asked, "What is it, Vaidehi? Why are you standing there like that?"
The man asked, "Where has Madhavan gone?"

Vaidehi was overwhelmed with wonder. She had never seen them before, and she didn't know if they were relatives. They had never visited before, yet they knew both their names correctly. As she thought this, she continued to observe them closely.

"What is this, daughter? Won't you ask us to come inside?" the woman asked.
They appeared to be an elderly couple. Thinking that perhaps their arrival might solve her troubles, Vaidehi invited them in. The couple came inside and sat down.

The man asked, "Where is Madhavan, daughter?"
"No, sir, he is in puja," Vaidehi replied.

"Do not distance us by calling me 'sir,' daughter. We are very close to you. My name is Narayanan, and her name is Lakshmi. I have known Madhavan since he was a child. Madhavan’s family and I lived in the same village. I saw Madhavan when he was very young; his father and I were in the same village. Later, they were transferred and moved here. I traveled to many places. My Lakshmi was very close to your mother-in-law. Just as I was with Madhavan’s family, she was with them. You wouldn't even have been born then. Before that, her father was transferred to another town. Later, we were married. It is all a long story. We are happy now. Since we are old, we thought we would travel from town to town, and so we came here."

While they were talking, Madhavan came out. For a moment, he wondered with surprise who they were. Then he thought, "Whoever they are, what does it matter to me?" and turned to leave. But he found he could not move from that spot. He stood there looking at them; they had completely captured his heart.

Narayanan said, "Come, Madhava, sit near me."
Without a word, Madhavan sat near him like a puppet.
"What, Madhava? Do you not recognize me?" Narayanan asked.
Madhavan looked closely and shook his head. "No, sir."

"You do not know me, but I know you very well," he said with a laugh. "Well, I was very close to your father. In those days, he had sent some money to help build a house. For some reason, I couldn't return it all this time. There were various problems. Now that I have some money in hand, I inquired about your house in the neighborhood and came here. I learned about all that has happened. It seems you are in trouble now. I am proud that this money is helping you at the right time." Turning to his wife Lakshmi, he said, "Take that amount and give it to him."

Lakshmi took the money and handed it to Madhavan. Madhavan could not understand what was happening. He wondered if it was a dream or reality. Then, taking the money, he said, "I will be right back," and went toward Kannan’s room.

Vaidehi watched them in amazement. She thought that with this amount, all debts, including her own, could be cleared.
"Well, shall we leave then?" the visitors asked.
"You have come as an elderly couple; please stay and eat before you go," she said.
Madhavan, having placed the money at Kannan’s feet, came out and said, "Yes," though he sounded somewhat reluctant.

"Madhava, we have come as a couple. If both of you serve us together as a couple, we shall stay and eat," Narayanan said.
Without even thinking about the state of the house, Vaidehi said, "We will certainly do that." Having said it, she suddenly looked at Madhavan in fear. Madhavan looked at Vaidehi silently, scolding her in his mind.

Vaidehi went inside to get tea for the guests without looking at Madhavan. Lakshmi followed Vaidehi inside. "What are you going to cook, Vaidehi?" she asked. That voice alone made Vaidehi’s heart happy. "What a beautiful voice! How beautiful she is! They look at us with such love," she thought, and with tears of joy, she said, "It is nothing, mother. I thought I would give you something to drink."

"We only want milk, daughter. Give us the milk now. When you start cooking, I will help you. We can both cook together." Vaidehi mixed milk for both of them.
"Why are you mixing it only for the two of us? Is there none for you?" Lakshmi asked.
"No, mother, we just drank some." In truth, there was no more milk inside. Vaidehi set out to take the milk to Narayanan.

"You are taking it to my husband, aren't you? Give it to me, I will take it myself. Only if I give it with my own hands will he be satisfied, and it will bring me joy too," Lakshmi said and took it.
"Why are they like this? We are the exact opposite," Vaidehi thought.

After drinking the milk, Narayanan looked at Madhavan and said, "Madhava, I hear bathing in the river here is wonderful. Let the two of them cook; we shall go to the riverbank. I have many dirty clothes; we can wash them, dry them, and bring them back. Will you help me?"
Madhavan nodded and said, "Come."

Narayanan called out loudly, "I am going to bathe! I am going to the river! You stay here and help Vaidehi."
A voice came from inside, "Go safely. Do not stay in the water for too long; it is not good for your health. Come back as soon as you finish bathing. If you are late, I will be worried here," Lakshmi said.

Madhavan looked at Narayanan and thought, "Why is he shouting like this just to go to the river nearby?"
Vaidehi looked at Lakshmi and thought, "This mother looks after him with such affection."
Narayanan and Madhavan went outside. Again, Narayanan said, "Lakshmi, bolt the door."
"I will bolt the door, you go," Lakshmi replied.
Seeing this, Madhavan felt like laughing. "What kind of couple are they?" he thought.

Narayanan and Madhavan walked toward the river. Only then did Madhavan notice that Narayanan did not have any dirty clothes in his hands. He had said he needed to wash clothes, but there were none. "Let it be, why should I care?" Madhavan thought and walked on. He led him to the place where everyone bathed. "Let's not bathe here. Let's go further away," Narayanan said and led him to a secluded spot. It was the place where Madhavan usually sat alone.

Lakshmi and Vaidehi began to cook. Lakshmi looked at Vaidehi and asked, "How many children do you have, Vaidehi?"
Vaidehi remained silent, not knowing what to say.
"What is it, Vaidehi? I am asking you," Lakshmi said.
"I have no children, mother," Vaidehi said softly.
"Why the silence for this? You could have just said no. Are you sad that you have no children?"

"Mother, I have no sadness about not having children," she said.
"Then why are you silent?"
"What should I say, and what should I leave out..." Vaidehi began to sob.
Lakshmi comforted Vaidehi, embracing her, and asked, "What happened, daughter?"

Vaidehi, who had been waiting for someone to ask her this, felt as if a great burden had been lifted. "They are so full of love, like my own mother. I shall tell her everything," she decided.
Holding Lakshmi’s hands, she said, "Mother, my husband does not speak to me. He does not even look at me."
"This is something new! Since when has he not spoken?" Lakshmi asked.
"From the day of my marriage until today—it has been about eleven years," Vaidehi said.

"If a man remains like this for eleven years, I cannot accept it. Is there some other attachment?" Lakshmi asked.
"Mother, please do not speak ill of him. He has no other attachments. His only bond is with Kannan. If he showed even a drop of that bond toward me, I would be satisfied," she cried.
"Vaidehi, who is this Kannan? I don't understand anything," Lakshmi asked.

"Mother, he developed a love for Lord Kannan at a very young age. When he was struggling for his life, a lady gave him an idol of Kannan. From that day on, he yearns for 'Kanna! Kanna!' He longs for the vision of that Kannan," she said, explaining everything that had happened.
"That is all well, but why get married if one is such a devotee of Kannan?" Lakshmi asked.

"That is where the mistake happened, mother. Should I call it my fate? Or a sin I committed? My father went to his mother many times and asked. His mother forced her son and made him agree to the marriage. Because of his mother’s compulsion, our marriage took place. On the very day it happened, he told me that he would never even look up at me, except for Kannan."

"Well, your story is something else," Lakshmi said. "If he didn't want marriage, he should have run away. Why bring you here and torture you?"
"On one hand, he is afraid that if he speaks to me, he will get caught in 'Maya' (illusion). On the other hand, he treats me like this to spite his parents."
"So, what have you been doing all this time?" Lakshmi asked.

"For some time, I served my father-in-law and mother-in-law. Later, since there were weddings and events at my relatives' houses, I would stay there for a month or two. Thus, I would stay away for six months a year. He would even give me money for it. He wouldn't say 'go' or 'don't go.' I would go on my own and come back on my own," Vaidehi said.
"Ah! That’s it. I see now—the fault is yours. You only told me one side," Lakshmi said.
Vaidehi was surprised. Looking at Lakshmi, she asked, "What mistake did I make, mother?"

"Listen, I will tell you. Listen carefully to the advice I give," she began. "A marital relationship is not just something created when a husband calls or out of lust. The loving services we perform are also part of that relationship. You say your husband doesn't speak to you! Have you ever spoken to him?"
"No, mother, I haven't spoken either. I am afraid to even speak," Vaidehi said.

"Why be afraid to speak? What wrong have we done to be afraid? If a husband were a brute, we might be afraid to speak. But you say your husband is a good man. Then why be afraid to speak?"
"The fear is—what if he scolds me or says something? What will I do then?"
"That is quite something. Who else has more right than a husband to scold you? Do you know that even that scolding can be sweet? You haven't understood correctly! When a husband is a devotee, we should also turn toward the path of devotion. When the husband goes one way, do we have another way? Shouldn't you provide the things he needs for his devotion? Your mother sings so well; didn't you learn to sing from her?" Lakshmi asked.

"I did learn, mother," Vaidehi said.
"Then you could sing beautifully about Kannan! You are losing out on a great life by thinking about a trivial one. Your husband is a devotee of Kannan; your devotion can be toward both your husband and Kannan. You can ensure you don't interfere with his devotion. Joy is found in the small services done for a husband. That is how he will develop an affection for us. It is not right to go to your parents' house frequently without your husband; I do not like that. If one has lost a husband, or if the husband is of bad character and a brute, one can try to reform him. If he still doesn't change, then one can go home. You must follow your husband’s path; going to your parents' house is not right. When he doesn't come with you, what business do you have there? Looking at it that way, it shows you have no concern for him, doesn't it? It is only respectful for you to go to your parents' house with your husband. If he doesn't wish to go, you shouldn't go either. Once a woman marries a man, she surrenders herself to him. For one who has surrendered thus, there is no such thing as 'I' or 'mine.' She becomes the very breath in her husband’s heart. It’s not that the husband just listens to her words; she explains what is good, bad, dharma, and justice. The husband accepts it and acts accordingly. In this, both husband and wife must give in to each other in every way and be loving at the same time. For one who has surrendered herself, the husband is both mother and father in place of her parents."

Vaidehi interrupted, "Mother, relatives will complain if I don't visit. They will speak ill of my husband."
"I would say my husband’s abode is Vaikuntha. You should do the same. Everyone should say this. When our husband looks after us well and keeps us with love, what worry do we have? Say, 'I will come if my husband comes; I cannot be apart from him.' Even then, if they find fault, realize they do not understand marital life and distance yourself from them. A wife is the reason for a husband being good and cultured. A wife should embrace and comfort him with love like a mother. This is what I like. If it is like this, there will be prosperity. If not, there will be no peace—which is what you are seeing now. Understand your husband’s likes and dislikes, provide what is needed, and conduct yourself accordingly. This is the advice I give you. I cannot be away from my husband; even now my heart yearns because he hasn't returned yet."

Vaidehi hugged Lakshmi, calling her "Mother," and cried. "No one has given me the right advice until now, mother. I have made a great mistake. Is there forgiveness for me? Am I even a woman? I was one without a motherly nature. I didn't realize that lust is something that comes naturally when affection matures; I remained arrogant because he didn't speak or call me. Having gained a good husband, I failed to follow his path. Everything I did was wrong, mother. From now on, I will follow his path. Will he at least look at me and call me then, mother? This wretched longing consumes me. It is enough if he just calls me; even if he doesn't speak words to me, it is fine. I will certainly not take the place of his devotion to Kannan or the place where Kannan resides. I will be a companion to him. I am not a sinner, am I, mother?" she asked like a small child.

"Who called you a sinner, Vaidehi? You are living without understanding; I am only telling you to live with understanding."
"Oh! Mother!" Lakshmi suddenly cried out as she clutched her own toe.
"What is it, mother? What happened?" Vaidehi asked in panic.
"My husband must be pulling my big toe; that is why it hurts. Didn't I tell you before? I am the breath in his heart. That is why I feel this pain."
