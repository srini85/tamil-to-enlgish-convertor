One morning as the day dawned, Madhavan woke up and said, "I intend to go to the river every morning to bathe before I return."

"By all means, go and bathe," Vaidehi said. "But be careful; do not lose yourself in your meditation of Kannan."

"No, Vaidehi, I will bathe safely and return," he said, and set out toward the river. After finishing his bath and prayers, he returned home at a leisurely pace. Upon entering Kannan’s room, he was struck with wonder. Kannan’s pavilion was decorated with flowers. A bright *kolam* had been drawn on the floor, and a sweet fragrance wafted through the air. Unknowingly, he stood there in awe, feeling as if Kannan himself was present. Everything required for the puja was ready.

Seeing Madhavan standing there, Vaidehi asked, "Why have you stopped like that? There is a large flower garden behind our house, but no one ever picks the flowers. Since I never had the time before, I used to pick only a few. Now that you will be going to the river to bathe, I will have the time to pick the flowers and keep everything ready."

Madhavan did not know what to say; a sense of pride filled his heart. He wondered if Kannan would grant her a vision. "Even I did not think of all this all these days," he thought as he sat down for the puja. That day, he felt a certain strength in his mind, happy that their Kannan was so beautifully adorned.

Their lives continued in this manner every day. One day, while Madhavan was sitting in his shop, an elder who visited regularly arrived with a fourteen-year-old boy.

The visitor said, "Madhava, his name is Govindan. He has no father, only a mother. They live at the edge of our town. The poor boy is in need. You can keep him in the shop to assist you."

Madhavan did not know what to say. He had the desire to help, but since Vaidehi managed all other affairs—and she had told him not to tell others that he needed to ask his wife—he thought for a moment and simply said, "Govinda, come to the house tomorrow morning."

Returning home in the afternoon, he recounted what had happened at the shop. "Fine, let him come tomorrow; I will see to it," she said. "From today, I want to start learning about Kannan’s birth and how Yashoda nurtured him during his childhood."

"So be it, Vaidehi. Likewise, you must write and sing a song about the child Krishna today," he said.

"I shall do so," she replied. "But you must grant me the grace to write it well."

"That Kannan will bless us both; do not worry," he said.

That evening, he began to describe the childhood of Kannan. In the way Madhavan narrated it, Vaidehi lost herself and transformed into Yashoda. She imagined Kannan in her lap and acted as if she were placing him in a cradle. Lost in the gesture of placing Kannan in the cradle and singing a lullaby, she truly began to sing. Seeing her sing, Madhavan realized she was not singing as herself; it was Yashoda describing and singing to Kannan. Thinking this, he stopped his narration and joined in the song. This is an example of how wisdom is not required for true devotion; it comes naturally.

After finishing the song, she sat in silence for a while. "Vaidehi, Vaidehi," Madhavan called out.

Startled, Vaidehi opened her eyes and asked, "What? Where am I?"

"My dear, you sang such a beautiful lullaby for Kannan," he said.

"Forgive me, I have made a mistake. While you were speaking, I unknowingly felt as if I was holding Kannan in my lap and fondling him. Please forgive me," she said.

"What is there to forgive? You sang beautifully. Even Kannan would have fallen asleep, lost in it. What wonderful expressions you have," Madhavan said.

"It is all because of what you taught me. Because you are near, even that Kannan danced like a child. Everything happens by your blessing. You are my Guru," she said, and continued, "I have some money left; we can make a beautiful silver cradle for Kannan."

"By all means, you may do so," he said.

After finishing her chores that day, Vaidehi went to sleep. Later, Madhavan sat gazing at Kannan; he could not sleep. "Kanna, what a wonder! What devotion Vaidehi has for you! She loves you even more than I do. How does she manage all her responsibilities and still show such love? I too should have such devotion; I should be immersed in thoughts of you. Kanna, do not leave me. Grant us both your vision, Kanna. I never thought Vaidehi would change her heart and be like this. You have given me a truly good wife," he thought, reflecting on many things before slowly falling asleep.

The next morning, he returned after his usual bath. Vaidehi looked at Madhavan and said, "Today, you can perform the puja calmly and then go to the shop. I have arranged things for Govindan. He will go and open the shop in the morning, have lunch with you in the afternoon, and return to the shop with me. He will come back early in the evening after locking up. Since he is a young boy, we will keep the money in our custody. He will also be helpful to me at home."

She continued rapidly, "Moreover, his mother is currently unwell. He said once she recovers, he will stay here." Madhavan did not seem to hear anything; his mind was on Kannan. He only asked one question in between: "Who is that Govindan?" Realizing he was not in his normal state of mind, she decided they could talk later.

Thus, Madhavan often lost awareness of his surroundings; his mind was always with Kannan. Understanding this state, Vaidehi acted accordingly.

Vaidehi went to collect the cradle she had ordered for Kannan. At the shop, there were idols of Kannan and Radha. Seeing them, Vaidehi wondered, "We only have Kannan; should I buy Radha?" She asked for just Radha.

"We do not sell Radha separately. Buy them together as Kannan and Radha," the shopkeeper said. Vaidehi was in a dilemma.

The shopkeeper said, "If you like, a very beautiful idol of Lakshmi has arrived. Would you like to see it?" The small idol was exquisite and suited Kannan perfectly. It captured her heart instantly, looking just like the Lakshmi who had entered her home. She paid the amount and bought both the cradle and the Lakshmi idol. Then a thought occurred: "What if my husband says no to Lakshmi?" She told the shopkeeper, "If my husband does not want it, I will return it tomorrow."

Bringing them home, she first showed the cradle to Madhavan. "It is very beautiful, perfectly suited for our Kannan," he said.

"Wait," she said and went inside. She brought out several small items: a tiny silk mattress, a small pillow, side pillows to keep Kannan from rolling, and a beautiful small velvet-like carpet to spread over it.

Madhavan was puzzled. "How did you buy all these tiny things?"

"I did not buy them; I made them myself whenever I found time," she said, placing the silk mattress in the cradle. Then she slowly showed him the Lakshmi idol. "I made a mistake without asking you. Lakshmi was so beautiful that I bought her. If you do not like it, I will return it tomorrow," Vaidehi said.

"Our devotion should always be focused on one, my dear. It should not waver. You should see that Lakshmi in the form of this Kannan himself. If we add too many things, devotion will scatter. Well, let it be. Since today's lesson is about the marriage of Kannan and Rukmini, let it stay here," he said, placing it in a spot.

He placed Kannan above and Lakshmi on the step below. "All our prayers are for Kannan; Lakshmi will join us in the puja," he said.

"Fine, in the morning I will bathe and decorate Lakshmi, and then you can do the same for Kannan," she said.

"Your heart must not waver from Kannan," he reminded her.

"I will act according to your wishes," she replied, satisfied that he agreed to keep Lakshmi.

Thus, their lives proceeded well, and they lived as a divine couple.
