Narayanan shouts "Ah!" while bathing.
Madhavan comes to see what happened and Narayanan says, "It is nothing, I just hurt my big toe."
"By the way, Madhava, aren't you coming to bathe?" he asked.
"No, I bathed early this morning and finished my prayers. How long will you keep bathing? Come, let us go," Madhavan replied.
"Hey! The grime hasn't washed off yet. You come and bathe too," Narayanan said, grabbing his hand and pulling him into the water. After pulling him in, he began walking further into the water.
"Sir, the current is very strong there; let us bathe right here," Madhavan said.
"It is all mud over there; it will only add more dirt," Narayanan said, pulling him along.
"Sir, I do not know how to swim," Madhavan said fearfully.
"Do you think I know how to swim? All I want is to wash off this grime. Madhava, who do you have devotion for?" he asked.
"Sir, you have known me since I was a child. Don't you know who I am devoted to?" he replied.
"As far as I know, in childhood it is for parents, in youth for friends, then for children, and then for grandchildren—that is how I think it goes," Narayanan said.
"Sir, do you have any sense? You are getting older and yet you speak like this. Can't you even say it is for God?" Madhavan scolded him.
Narayanan smiled and asked, "What is the need for such devotion and affection for someone who cannot be seen by the eyes?"
"Sir, if you speak like this, I will push you into this fast-running water! I cannot bear anyone speaking ill of that Kannan," Madhavan shouted.
"Oh, so you are a devotee of Kannan? That is why you get so angry," Narayanan asked with a smile.
"Sir, I am indeed a devotee of Kannan. It was wrong of me to speak harshly to you, please forgive me. I just could not bear it when you spoke ill of that Kannan."
"Wouldn't the same justice apply even if it were your wife?" Narayanan asked.
"Sir, what is there to hide from you? To this day, I have not even looked up at my wife's face."

"What do you mean by that?" Narayanan asked.
"Sir, I think of no one in my heart except my Kannan."
"Then why do you have a wife?" he asked.
"Sir, it was a mistake made by my parents. Even though I said I didn't want it, they insisted and married me off."
"In that case, you are punishing your wife for the mistake your parents made."
"What are you trying to say now, sir?" Madhavan asked.
"What else? You don't even have faith in yourself."
"What are you saying, sir? I don't understand at all," he said.
"Isn't it the fear that if you speak to your wife, you will fall into the illusion of family life? If that is so, doesn't it mean your devotion to Kannan is not pure?"
"Sir, please do not say such things," Madhavan said and began to cry. In all his life, this was the first time he had cried in front of another person.
"Then what, sir? You and your devotion! There can be determination in devotion, but there should be no fear of illusion (Maya). Your devotion should be great enough to drive away illusion," Narayanan said. "You are afraid that lust will take hold of you."

"I don't want any family life, sir. It is enough if I have that Kannan. I don't know what sin I committed, but that Kannan has not yet given me his vision (darshan). Is there no way for all this?" he asked while weeping.
"You are a fool. True marriage does not lie in lust; it lies in love and affection. When love and affection increase, lust is something that comes naturally through the power of nature," Narayanan said, and while speaking, he suddenly pushed Madhavan into the fast-flowing water.
Madhavan closed his eyes and screamed, "Kanna!" Someone grabbed his hand and pushed him back toward Narayanan. Madhavan opened his eyes; for a few minutes, he didn't know what had happened. Then, looking at Narayanan, he asked, "Sir, why did you push me?"
"If it is true that I pushed you, how did you end up back here?" he asked.
"That is what I don't understand, sir. Someone pulled me and placed me near you," Madhavan said.
"What did you say when you closed your eyes?" he asked.
"I shouted 'Kanna!', sir," he replied.
"According to you, it must have been that Kannan who pulled you back, right?" he said.
"Could it be true, sir? Did that Kannan pull me?"
"Yes, I pulled you. Consider that Kannan pulled you through me. Why did I push you? Why did I save you?"
"I pushed you, and you cried out 'Kanna!'. I saved you. What do you understand from this?" he asked.
"Sir, I don't understand any of these antics you perform," Madhavan replied.
"If He saved you the moment you called 'Kannan', won't He save you in your family life too? Why don't you understand? A family situation has been created. That was a mistake you made, and those responsible have faced their consequences and left. Poor girl, what betrayal did Vaidehi commit against you? Why are you tormenting her like this? She has come seeking you. Why don't you teach her this devotion? You can tell her about Kannan every day, can't you? Both of you can live with love and affection and offer your devotion to Kannan. You have two eyes, two legs, and two hands—aren't they all for service? Can't your wife also be dedicated to the service of that Kannan?"
"Suppose she doesn't listen to you; you can try to correct her. If she still doesn't listen, you can send her to her mother's house and let her go as she pleases. Instead of that, is it right for her to sit in one corner and you in another? Think well, Madhava. Her going to her mother's house frequently because you are not there—doesn't that diminish your respect? When you keep Kannan in your house and protect Him, why can't you keep your wife and protect her? Why should you send her to others' houses? Just as you do not part from your Kannan, you should not part from her. If she says good things, we can accept them. If they are not right, we can correct her. Similarly, we can correct ourselves. Only if both understand each other and live with compromise will the path you walk be good. Madhava, from now on, teach her everything about Kannan. Lead her in your path. This is my command of love," Narayanan said.
"Sir, is it because of the mistake I made all this time that Kannan did not give me his vision? Am I a great sinner? Won't that Kannan give me his vision?" he cried in many ways.
Narayanan stroked his head and said, "You fool, Kannan is always near you. Didn't He help you the moment you called? You made a mistake unknowingly. From now on, knowing better, offer your devotion together."
"Sir, I did not respect it at first, but now I understand well. From now on, I will listen to your words and instruct Vaidehi about Kannan. Let that Kannan be my help," he said.
"Alright, come Madhava, let's go. I have bathed to wash off the grime and I am feeling hungry. My wife will be waiting. I hurt my foot, didn't I? Watch how she mentions it there! Witness that miracle," he said, and both left the river and returned home.
As they reached the entrance of the house, Lakshmi ran out in a panic and asked, "Dear, did you hurt your foot? Couldn't you be careful while bathing?"

"It's nothing, Lakshmi, just a small injury, that's all. Why are you afraid for this? I have bathed and come back; I am hungry," he said to Lakshmi.
"I have cooked well here. Both of us just need to eat and then we must leave," she said.
Madhavan and Vaidehi looked at each other in amazement as they watched the two of them talking like young children.
"The cooking is good," Narayanan said.
"You have bathed to wash off the grime," Lakshmi said.
Vaidehi lowered her head and went inside. Madhavan went toward the room where Kannan was. "Where are you going, son? You both must serve us food. Our work here is done, and we must leave for our town," Narayanan and Lakshmi said.
"It's nothing, sir. I will just go worship Kannan and come," Madhavan said.
Vaidehi was surprised to hear Madhavan's voice, wondering, "Is he the one speaking like this?"
They laid out the leaves and seated the couple. Vaidehi and Madhavan served food to the couple. Seeing this, Narayanan and Lakshmi smiled at each other and ate, saying, "Only today are we truly satisfied." After finishing their meal, both stood up.

Lakshmi looked at Vaidehi and said, "Put food for your husband in my husband's leaf, and you eat from my leaf. It is very good to eat from the leaf of an elder couple or a Guru. It is rare to get the chance to sit at the leaf of a good elder couple. May you receive all blessings."
It was on that day that Vaidehi and Madhavan worshipped together.
"Shall we leave? It is getting late," they said.
Unable to bear the separation, both Madhavan and Vaidehi shed tears.
"Do not cry. The time will come. When it comes, you will meet us," they said and left.
They shed tears looking in the direction the couple had gone. Then, Vaidehi served food to Madhavan in Narayanan's leaf. After eating, Madhavan went to Kannan's room and sat before Him. Vaidehi sat at Lakshmi's leaf and ate.
Vaidehi went to Kannan's room to speak with Madhavan. She saw Madhavan with his eyes closed, in tears. Seeing this, Vaidehi prayed, "O Lord, give him your vision. He has never seen such peace until now. Even if he has no affection for me, it is fine, but do not forsake him. I want no pleasures for myself; the vision you give him is my pleasure. He should never cry."

Madhavan prayed to Kannan, "Kanna, a wife has come into my life. Give her your vision too. Lead her on this path as well. If she does not agree, then separate us; I do not want her to suffer because of me," he wept.
Kannan smiled.
