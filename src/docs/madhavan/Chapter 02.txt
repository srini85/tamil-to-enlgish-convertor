Chapter 2
Days turned into months. Madhavan developed a unique habit: whenever anyone gave him something or whenever he ate, he would first place it near the idol of Krishna. He would say, "I will eat once, then you eat once," and then place both portions into his own mouth. He refused to sleep anywhere except in the space where Krishna was kept; he made that sanctuary his own world. Whether he was playing or simply struck by a sudden thought, he would frequently run back to gaze upon the idol. In this manner, he grew a little older.

During this time, his father was transferred to another town. The three of them moved to a place that Madhavan liked immensely. The town was nestled near mountains, and a river flowed gracefully through it. In this new home, the parents dedicated a room specifically for Krishna, installing a beautiful pedestal (Mandapam) for the idol.

As Madhavan enrolled in a larger school, his higher studies and time spent playing with new friends increased. Seeing this, Madhavan’s mother grew worried. She feared her son might neglect his spiritual discipline. One day, she spoke to him sternly.

"You go out to play every evening, and no one is here to look after things. You are leaving your Krishna all alone. In the mornings, your father is overwhelmed with office work, and he is getting late because he has to bathe and tend to Krishna. Why can’t you take over that responsibility? Similarly, why can’t you go and fetch the flowers and items needed for the daily offerings instead of me? You could even start a small flower garden. We are getting older, Madhavan. Shouldn’t you at least take responsibility for your own Krishna?"

She spoke this way believing that if he took on these duties, he would stop wandering and become more responsible at home. Madhavan approached the idol, beaming with joy. "Kanna! They have left you to me! From tomorrow, I will be the one taking care of you. Because I am looking after you myself, I have great faith that you will surely come for me soon!" From that day on, he took over every duty related to Krishna.

His parents were astonished. Madhavan stopped going out to play in the evenings; instead, he tended to the garden meticulously. Every spare moment was spent gathering information and stories about Krishna. He became a "good boy" who stayed home, but as he matured, a deep ache began to settle in his heart.

"You have appeared before so many devotees, Kanna. Why are you testing me?" he would cry daily, clutching the feet of the idol. "I will not let go until you appear before me!"

He was afraid to share these feelings with his parents. I am grown up now, he thought. I shouldn't trouble them with everything. I shouldn't sink them into my grief. Would they even understand? He noticed that his parents often acted as if they didn't see his struggle. Consequently, he grew silent, suffering within himself and withdrawing from everyone.

Once Madhavan finished his education, his father insisted he find a job. Obeying him, Madhavan joined a workplace, but he could not bear it. Witnessing the lies, cheating, and unrighteousness (Adharma) that took place there, he quit and returned home. He believed that if he participated in such dishonesty, Krishna would never come. He isolated himself, spending his time sitting alone by the riverbank or the foothills.

One morning, after his bath, Madhavan went inside to perform the ritual bath (Abhishekam) for the idol. There was a loud commotion at the neighbor's house. His parents exchanged looks, and his mother went out to investigate. When she returned, the father asked, "What was that noise next door?"

"It’s nothing," she replied. "The neighbor's son—who is older than Madhavan—fell in love with a girl. Since both sets of parents refused to consent, he took the girl and ran away early this morning."

The father remarked, "Well, they should have just married them off! They should do what the boy desires; after all, he is the one who has to live his life. Parents must understand this and allow children their wishes. Anyway, why should we get involved?" He then left for work.

Madhavan, while bathing the idol, thought bitterly, They give advice to others, but they don't understand the struggle in my own heart. What kind of parents are they? Everyone is selfish. They don't reflect on themselves when they preach to others. It’s better to remain silent than to give empty advice. Do they even know what they are doing? Kanna, when are you going to come? When will I escape from this crowd?

He finished his morning prayers and came out. His father asked, "Madhavan, are you going to look for a job or not? You can finish your prayers and go to work—let Krishna come and see you there if He wants."

"Father, don't speak without understanding. I don't like work that involves cheating. I don't like telling lies. I don't like unrighteousness."

"What you say is true," his father replied. "We should be pure within ourselves, but don't worry about others. Once you join a profession, you must do your job. Don't be stubbornly idle."

Madhavan felt a sharp pain in his heart. Why does he torment me? Will he never understand? He retreated to his room in silence. Later, his mother came and sat beside him compassionately. "Madhavan, what is the meaning of sitting in this room all the time?"

Madhavan thought back to when he was a child and she scolded him for "leaving Krishna alone" to go wandering. He laughed at the irony. "Why are you laughing?" she asked. "It’s nothing, Amma. Just a memory. I was laughing at a thought." "Are you going to go to work?" she pressed. "Amma, I want to see Krishna. Won't He come?"

"Madhavan, what is this childishness? You have read so many books and know so much—how can you speak like this? Don't you see how hard your father works? Don't you want to take up family responsibilities?" She sighed and left the room.

Madhavan looked at the idol. "Kanna, won't you come? What is happening? I cannot live without seeing you. I have no desire for worldly work or unrighteousness. Show me a way!" He began to wonder if his parents found him a financial burden. Everything is run on Appa's salary. Is that why they are frustrated? Fine, from today, I will stop eating.

Madhavan did not eat for three days. His mother eventually came to him. "Madhavan, is this right? You haven't touched food in three days." "Amma, I thought I should stop being an expense to you." "You fool! A child is never an 'expense' to parents. We only said those things because we want to see you successful and happy like other children."

"So, did you raise me only for your own selfish satisfaction?" Madhavan asked. "That Krishna saved my life and gave me back to you—shouldn't I do something for Him? You once said we are indebted to Him. Now, leave me to Him! Until I have His Darshan, I will do nothing else."

"Your father is grieving over you, and you remain so stubborn! I am caught between the two of you," she lamented. "Fine, there is someone nearby who gives 'divine oracles' (Arul Vakku). Will you come with me to see him?"

"Why should I go there?" "To see if there is a way out of our family situation." "Amma, have you gone mad? We are fine by Krishna's grace. If you want to ask about me, I can tell you myself: I want Krishna to appear, and I will wait for him. Besides, Amma, when we have our own Guru who has actually seen Krishna, why should we go to these people?"

"I don't have his proper address, son." "Don't worry, Amma. I will find it within a week." "Fine, find it for me," she said and left.

Madhavan was filled with a sense of triumph. Kanna, my time of deliverance has come! I will find the Guru’s address and take my parents to him. He will explain everything to them. They won't listen to me, but they won't talk back to him. With this hope, he began to eat again.

Within a week, Madhavan found the Guru’s location and ran to his mother happily. "Amma! Our Guru has finished his travels. He has built a temple for Krishna at the foot of a mountain and a small hut for himself. He is staying there peacefully. Many people visit him. There is a small river nearby, but it is in a forest area. We have to go by vehicle to a certain point and then walk through the forest. He has advised people not to travel that forest path at night. Shall we go?"

"Let your father return; we will all go together," she said. Madhavan spent the evening preparing, assuming they would all leave. However, when the father returned and heard the news, he said, "Madhavan has done a good job. We will leave tomorrow. But... let Madhavan stay here to look after the house and Krishna. We two will go first, see how it is, and then we can take Madhavan later."

Madhavan was devastated. What confusion will they create there? Will the Guru understand me? This is a terrible dilemma. I can't insist on going because I have no money of my own. If they need me, I must look after Krishna; if not, I must go to work. Why won't they understand me? He fell asleep in deep sorrow.

The next morning, the parents prepared to leave. The father said, "I will tell the Guru everything about you. You must obey whatever he says. Understood?" "Fine," Madhavan replied. "But make sure you tell him the truth as well."

After they left, Madhavan sat before the idol. "Kanna, send back good news. Give me a way out of this cage. Give me your vision. Come quickly—I am waiting only for you. Don't you understand? Won't you come soon?"

The parents arrived at the ashram. Since it was crowded with devotees, they decided to walk around the premises first and wait for a quiet moment. When the crowd thinned, they approached the Mahatma and paid their respects.

"Are you all well?" the Mahatma asked. "By God's grace and your blessings, we have no complaints. Was your journey successful, Swami?" "Everything went well by Krishna's grace. Following His command, I have built this temple and ashram to stay here permanently. Tell me, did your son Madhavan not come? He must be grown like a sturdy tree by now! Is he still mischievous, or has he become a good boy? He used to ask so many questions—such a fine child."

The father replied, "He is a good boy and has grown well. He has finished his studies too. But..." "But what? It sounds like you are leading up to something," the Mahatma noted. "Yes, Guru. We need to speak with you at length. If you could spare some time for us, it would be a great help." "Fine, we shall speak in the evening," the Mahatma said and moved away.

The parents finished their meal and spoke with others at the ashram, hearing stories of how different people had come to stay there. The mother whispered, "We should move here too. It is so peaceful." "If your son behaves properly, what is the problem? We can move," the father agreed. They spent the afternoon admiring the sanctity of the place.

In the evening, the Guru called for them. "Come, sit. Tell me what is troubling you. I will do what I can." They bowed and sat near him. The father said, "It is about Madhavan." "What is wrong with him? Tell me in detail," the Mahatma urged.

The mother said, "Madhavan is constantly thinking of nothing but Krishna." The father added, "He stubbornly refuses to do anything until he sees Krishna. He won't go to work because of his obsession with 'honesty' and 'righteousness.' He just sits by the idol at home, or spends his time by the river or on the mountain."

"Madhavan? Really! How did he develop such devotion?" the Mahatma asked, acting as if he knew nothing. The mother explained, "Sir, he took the playful words you said in his childhood far too seriously. This is the result." She narrated everything that had happened from his childhood to the present day.

The Mahatma listened and said, "What great devotion! It brings me such joy to hear this. Such piety is rare—perhaps one in a million possesses it. You have done a great deal of merit (Punyam) to give birth to such a soul. I must see Madhavan."

"Sir, he hasn't come. Should we just leave him as he is? What should we do?" the father asked. "How can you ask that? Bring him to me! It is rare to find such a pure devotee, especially if he is the son of my own disciples."

The mother hesitated. "Sir, he is our only son. How can we leave him with you?" "Whether it is one son or a hundred, a mother blessed with such a child should let him go. Let him do good for the world." "Sir, we cannot bear to be separated from him," the father said.

"Who is separating from whom? Who is joining whom? This is all just an illusion (Maya). If you look at it that way, did Krishna not go elsewhere immediately after being born? For the welfare of the world, one must give up their child. Parents should shed the selfishness of 'my child' and realize that God has channeled a pure soul through them. You should feel grateful to the Lord instead of acting like this."

The mother cried, "Our minds are not yet mature enough, Swami. We cannot exist without him." "Who stays with whom? We come alone and we leave alone. These relationships are just things that happen in between. Just imagine your son is working in another town."

"Sir, even if he were elsewhere, if he were married and had children, my heart would be happy. I could go and play with my grandchildren," the mother sobbed. "All that is unnecessary imagination. No one can say for sure how life will turn out. Empty fantasies are not needed. The mark of good parents is to let a child follow his heart. If a child goes down a wrong path, it is the duty of the parents to correct him—failing to do so is a sin. But when a child is going down a good path, preventing him is an even greater sin."

There was a long silence. Finally, the father said, "Sir, despite everything you say, our minds are not at peace. For now, please tell us a way for Madhavan to move forward."

The Mahatma saw that they were blinded by attachment (Maya) and perhaps bound by their Karma. "Everything must be decided by Krishna," he said. After a moment of silence, he suggested, "Since Madhavan does not want a regular job, why don't you open a small grocery shop for him? It will give him a chance to meet many people. Let's see how his mindset changes then."

The parents were relieved and happy. "Yes, we will open a shop immediately," they said. They bowed to the Mahatma and said they would leave the next morning.

"Let everything happen according to Krishna's will," the Mahatma said. Inwardly, he thought, Madhavan, forgive me. I have said as much as I could, but they won't listen. You have the power to break your own cage; it is a wonder you haven't done it yet! Lord, I have grown the tree—whether it is useful or not, I leave it in Your hands. You must find a way for this.
