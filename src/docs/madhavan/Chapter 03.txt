Madhavan's parents returned home. Madhavan welcomed them with affection and asked, "Did you see the Guru? What did he say?"
Madhavan's father replied, "He has asked us to set up a good shop for you."
"A good shop?" he asked in surprise.
"Yes, he told us to set up a shop for you."
"Mother, tell me exactly what happened," he said.
His mother recounted everything that had transpired.
"Mother, you say people like me are there; then why didn't you have the heart to leave me there?"
"Madhava, you are our only son. Where will you go, leaving us? You can serve us, look after the shop, and take care of Kannan as well."
Madhavan's father added, "We will not do anything bad to you. You will need money after my time, won't you? That is why we are making these arrangements. We have spoken to the Guru, and this decision was made only after he agreed."
"Don't say he agreed; say that you made him agree, Father," said Madhavan.
"Well, whatever it may be, let us see what needs to be done," he replied.

Madhavan slowly asked his mother, "Shall I go and see him once?"
"No, son. Are we lying? We told you exactly what happened. Why don't you just do as we wish?" she said.
Some time passed. A good grocery shop was found for Madhavan. At an auspicious time, they opened the shop. Having no other choice, Madhavan had to look after the shop. Every day, after finishing the puja for Kannan in the morning, he would go to the shop. From there, he would keep thinking of Kannan. A sense of strength arose within his heart. He began looking forward to Kannan every day, thinking that Kannan might even appear right there. If anyone spoke beautifully and wonderfully about Kannan, he would let them go without taking any money.
In the evening, he would go home, worship Kannan, and sit by the riverbank for a while. His days began to pass like this. "Kanna, will my life continue like this? When will you grant me your vision? What kind of life is this?" he yearned, asking questions within himself.

His affection for his parents began to diminish gradually. He was functioning like a machine, without any attachment to life. One day, in the early morning, after bathing Kannan and finishing the pujas, he ate his food, took his lunch, and went to the shop. After opening the shop and finishing his work, he sat down, saying, "Kanna, when will you grant me your vision? When will all this end? Please show your grace soon."
At that moment, an elderly man came and stood near the shop. He looked handsome, possessed character, and seemed compassionate. Upon seeing him, Madhavan's heart was drawn toward him. "Who could this be? He looks like a saint," he thought while watching him.
The elderly man smiled and asked, "Why are you looking at me like that, son?"
"I feel like I could keep looking at you, Sir! Who are you? Where are you coming from?" he asked.
"I come from somewhere, and I am going somewhere. Why do you need to know about me? Were you praying just now for your shop to have good business?"
"No, Sir, I did not pray for that. I was thinking about my Kannan, that's all," he said, thinking to himself why he should tell this man other details when he hadn't said anything about himself.

"Who is this Kannan, son? Is he your son?" he asked.
"Sir, why are you teasing me so early in the morning? I was talking about Lord Kannan," he said.
"Have you seen that Kannan?" he asked.
"If I had seen him, why would I be here?" he replied irritably.
"Fine, if you had seen him, where would you have gone?"
"If I had seen him, I would have asked my Kannan and gone wherever I needed to go."
"Do you have a desire to see Kannan?"
"Sir, why are you bothering me so much? I am living only to see that Kannan."
"What if your life ends without seeing him?"
"Sir, please leave this place. It is frightening even to hear those words."
"Alright, don't be angry. When this life departs, does the body know?"
"How could it know, Sir?"
"In that case, does the soul cry because it is leaving this body?"

"Certainly not."
"When the time comes for life to depart, it must depart. At that time, where will neighbors, friends, and relatives be? If so, if the soul decides to leave this shell, it can leave anyway, can't it? If it is determined to leave the shell, it will leave. Well, let it be. Why should I bother you in the morning? I am hungry. I eat only from pure devotees. You look like a devotee. If you have anything to eat, please give it."
"Sir, I have the food I brought for lunch. Shall I give that? Or shall I buy you something?"
"No, no. Two morsels of what you have are enough."
Madhavan gave him two morsels from his food. The elderly man ate it happily. After eating, he said, "If you find it hard to pass the time, keep chanting 'Sri Krishnaya Namaha, Sri Krishnaya Namaha' within your heart when you are alone, when you go out, and when you are at home."
"Sir, if I keep saying this, will Kannan definitely come? Will he see me?" he asked.
"Kannan is watching everyone. It is just that those who see him do not recognize him. Fine, you keep chanting," he said and walked away slowly.
Madhavan watched the path he took.

Meanwhile, customers arrived at the shop, and he began his work.
Madhavan began to say "Sri Krishnaya Namaha" within his heart every day. He felt as if some burden had been lifted from his mind. He minded his own business and his work. He did not speak much to anyone; he only answered his parents when they asked something. "Kanna, when will you grant me your vision? My mind feels somewhat peaceful now. It is enough if you grant your vision now; I am waiting for you. My parents are also minding their own business. They are not a trouble to me. When will you grant your vision? Has your heart not softened yet? I have faith that you will grant your vision. I will not let you go, Kanna; you must come somehow. Come soon," he prayed within himself every day. While praying like this, he kept his mind calm.
One fine morning, Madhavan finished his pujas. He went to eat. After eating, he prepared to go to the shop. At that time, Madhavan's mother said, "Madhava, I need to speak with you."
"Tell me, Mother, what do you want?" he asked.
"You are going to the shop now. Go, we shall speak later," she said.
"It's alright, whatever it is, tell me now, Mother."
"I will tell you if you won't get angry," she said.
"Fine, at least tell me what it is," he said.

"It is nothing. Everyone your age has gotten married. People who see me ask when Madhavan's wedding is. I haven't said anything. One or two people have even come forward to give their daughters in marriage. I told them I wouldn't say anything without asking you. What do you say?"
"Mother, I will not speak about anything right now. I will come and speak with you later," he said and left.
Madhavan's mother watched him as he left the house, wondering what he was going to say.
Madhavan sat in the shop, his mind restless. "What is this new beginning, Kanna? Until now, I thought I was at peace. Don't these parents have any other work? Won't they understand me? Are all parents selfish? Why do they say I must go by their wishes? Why can't I live according to my own wishes? Can't things happen as I think? Am I going on a wrong path? Is there an obstacle even to going on a good path? Kanna, where did they suddenly get this idea? I don't know when these thoughts will leave them. Kanna, won't you let me be at peace?" he was confused in many ways. He was scolding his parents internally. He struggled, wondering what to do. He decided to say it was absolutely impossible.
If he went and spoke in the evening, his father would be there, and it would lead to unnecessary problems. So, he closed the shop at noon and went to speak with his mother.

He closed the shop at noon and went. His mother was sitting there. "Come, Madhava. Have you closed the shop and come back?"
"My mind is not right, Mother, so I came," he said.
"I am asking you to get married for the sake of the world, Madhava."
"What is 'the world', Mother?"
"Relatives, kin, and neighbors—they are the world."
"Mother, didn't Vinayagar circle his parents saying they were the world?"
"Look here, don't beat around the bush. I am not a sage to talk to you at that level."
"You yourself have called me a sage; then why marriage, Mother?"
"Don't talk back to me, Madhava. I don't know how to answer you. Everyone looks at me and asks if I haven't married off Madhavan. I cannot tell society that he doesn't want to get married and so he didn't. Then they will talk however they please."
"What is 'society', Mother?"
"Yes, you have never visited any relative's house, never gone to the neighbors, and never participated in any auspicious or inauspicious events. What do you know about society?" she said.

"Why do we need society, Mother? For us, Kannan is the only society. We can live trusting him. You talk about society when you need it. If you cannot make society obey you, I don't need a society that talks differently to different people. Those who understand me well and accept that there is justice in my actions are the true society for me. Why does someone who walks the path of integrity need society? Let us walk with integrity, bow to justice, and live trusting Kannan; then what can this society do to us? If we live according to everything society says, when can we live according to our own wishes? What business do we have in a place full of idle talkers and gossipers, Mother? If our wish is just, we can even cast them aside. If we go by their wishes, we certainly cannot live in peace. Set society aside. Please understand me a little better. Leave me to my path, Mother."

"Madhava, wouldn't I have a desire to marry off my son? Wouldn't I want to say proudly that there is a daughter-in-law in my house too? Can't you get married at least for my sake? She will look after the household chores and take care of you as well. Think about it carefully," she said, tears flowing.

"Mother, if you have such a desire, you adopt a son and do everything for him. Leave me alone. I will certainly not agree to this," said Madhava.

"At least for the sake of the mother who gave birth to you, think well and come to a decision," she said, going inside while weeping.
Madhavan went near Kannan and bumped his head against Kannan's feet. "Kanna, what is this? Marriage, then children—do I need such an illusory life? Why don't they understand that I am living only for you? They are torturing me again and again. Why such a punishment for me? Is there no one to understand me? Kanna, grant me your vision and take me with you. I don't want this worldly life at all. I don't like living with these selfish humans. Take me away," he cried and began his daily chanting.
